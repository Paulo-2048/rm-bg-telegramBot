> The project aims to build a Telegram bot where the user can send an image, and the bot returns the same image but without the background. It is then hosted on a server to run 24/7.

### Adjustments and improvements

The project has been initially completed, but I will consider new functionalities in case there are new pull requests. Current Features:

- [x] Integration with Telegram
- [x] Remove background through API
- [x] Free hosting on Heroku (Deprecated)

## ðŸ’» Prerequisites

Before you start modifying, make sure you have met the following requirements:
* You have installed the latest version of `Python`
* You have installed the necessary libraries from `requirements.txt`, which is among the repository files
* You have a machine `<Windows / Linux / Mac>`.

## â˜• Using Remove-Background-TelegramBot [Not available]

To use it, you only need a Telegram account and to call the bot:
* Search for `@background_remove_bot` on Telegram
* Send the start command `/start`
* Send an image file or a photo
* The bot will return the same image without the background

* Important: Free plans were used for both the background removal API and the Heroku account, so there may be limitations and possibly it won't work for a long time.
